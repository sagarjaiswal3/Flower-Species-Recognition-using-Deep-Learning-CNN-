# 🌸 Flower Species Recognition using Deep Learning (CNN)

A professional deep learning project that automatically identifies and classifies flower species from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This system demonstrates the use of computer vision and artificial intelligence for accurate flower recognition.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Flower species recognition is an important task in computer vision with applications in botany, agriculture, biodiversity conservation, and environmental research. Manual identification is time-consuming and prone to errors due to visual similarities between flowers.

This project uses a CNN-based deep learning model to classify flower images into five categories:

* Daisy
* Dandelion
* Rose
* Sunflower
* Tulip

The model is trained and evaluated in Google Colab using TensorFlow and Keras.
